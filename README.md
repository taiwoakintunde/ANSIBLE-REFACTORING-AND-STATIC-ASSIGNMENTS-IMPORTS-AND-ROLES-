# ANSIBLE-REFACTORING-AND-STATIC-ASSIGNMENTS-IMPORTS-AND-ROLES-

In this project I will deploy and configure UAT Web Servers using Ansible imports and roles!

This project will allow me to refactor my Ansible code, create assignments, and learn how to use the imports functionality. 

>Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook â€“ it allows you to organize your tasks and reuse them when needed.
